# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Our client, Louise, just completed a Kickstarter campaign for a play she wanted to produce
and came remarkably close to achieving her goal in a short amount of time. Given her recent
experience, she hired our firm to analyze data of other Kickstarter campaigns and 
determine what difference the length of the campaign or the fundraising goal plays in
the ultimate success of the campaign. By interpreting multiple data sets it is believed
that we will be able to offer Louise the best opportunity for success on her next
campaign.

### Analysis Methodology

The data used for the analysis consist of thirteen hundred and sixty-nine individual Kickstarter
campaigns and spans several countries. Two separate analysis have been created; one to analyze
campaigns based on their launch date and a second analysis of campaigns based on their
campaign's monetary goals.

### Methodology of The Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

In looking at the data based on launch date, our team first needed to find a common unit
that both the client would understand and made the data manageable. It was determined
that dividing the data up by months was best. In addition, the data was sorted by
whether the campaign was "successful", "failed", or "canceled". 

### Methodology of The Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The second analysis was to take the campaign goals of each Kickstarter campaign and sort
them by separating them into increments of approximately $5,000. The result was twelve
categories ranging from under $1000 to over $50,000. Again, the campaigns were also
sorted by whether they were "successful", "failed", or "canceled".

## Outcomes Based on Launch Date Results

On review several conclusions can be made using the launch date as an indicator of
when to begin a Kickstarter campaign. First, the summer months contained the most
numerous examples of successful campaigns. Furthermore, the winter months contained
the least number of successful campaigns. December, in particular was a difficult
month with just about as many successful campaigns as campaigns that failed. Given
that the data was focused on plays, the results might correlate with the fact 
that many plays can use outdoor venues in the summer, while in the winter fewer
spaces are available. Deeper analysis on holiday spending and campaign donations 
should also be examined to determine if they are competing for the same dollars.
In conclusion, the team would suggest to Louise to start her campaign in the summer
and in particular start it during the month of May. 

## Outcomes based on Goals

In analyzing the data based on the goal amount several points can be made. Campaigns that
target a lower dollar amount tend to perform better than those that target larger sums.
The most successful campaigns targeted below a $5000 goal. The only exception was in
the $35,000 to $45,000 range. While this range was not as successful as the below
$5000 target, it did have over a 66% success rate. The problem with this data however,
is that the sample size was very small and consisted of too few campaigns to be
without doubt. In order to verify the conclusions presented by the current data, more 
analysis needs to be done on a larger sample size. Based on the teamâ€™s analysis Louise
should set a goal of no more than $15000 and she would be more successful if her 
campaign target was below $5,000.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

As with any analysis this project was beholden to the data that was present.
Key items that were missing from the data included, 1) The city in which the play would 
take place, 2) The origin of the Kickstarter campaign (i.e. was it being done by an 
individual or a large group of people), 3) And finally the economic climate of the 
particular year the Kickstarter campaign was launched (The New York theatre district
was shuddered for several months after the events of 9/11). A geographic map of 
where each campaign was launched from would be very useful, as well as the demographic
data of the individual donors. Donor information is a key element that is not 
present within the current data.
